### Inspiration
- This website design is heavily inspired by [anahoward.me](https://anahoward.me) and [saku.zone](https://saku.zone)

### TODO

- [ ] Add better animations
  - [ ] Some anime character sliding down like Naruto
  - [ ] Probably some voice line like "Dattebayo!" during above animation
  - [ ] Redo some animations using framer-motion
- [ ] Add currently listening and recent songs to Spotify grid cell
- [ ] Get Work and Projects data via a config file
- [ ] Convert the app into a PWA
- [ ] Refactor code
